## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Accessibility

## Languages

English in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts` is the source catalog. `MessageCatalog` is derived from its `errors` keys, so every other language file must use the same keys. Italian in `src/i18n/locales/it.ts` is checked with `satisfies MessageCatalog`.

`src/i18n/index.ts` registers the catalogs. On load, the app walks `navigator.languages`, keeps the language part (`it` from `it-IT`), and uses the first catalog that exists. Anything else falls back to `en`. `messageForProblem` returns the catalog string for a known problem `code`. `UNKNOWN` is the fallback when the code is missing. An unknown code uses the response `detail` when there is one.

To add a language, add a file such as `src/i18n/locales/fr.ts` with the same `errors` keys, import it in `src/i18n/index.ts`, and add it to `catalogs` under its language code (`fr`).

## Deployment

### Local deployment

From the frontend directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install (if not already installed) and use the compatible node version

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

Install the Node dependencies with yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/auth` to `http://localhost:8000`. The FastAPI server has to be running on port 8000. `yarn start` only serves the UI.

## Testing

### Unit tests

Run unit tests with

```bash
yarn test
```

### Coverage

[@vitest/coverage-v8](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage) reports how much of the source the tests exercise. It is a dev dependency, installed with `yarn install`.

```bash
yarn vitest run --coverage
```

`vitest run` runs the suite once and exits. The report prints a summary and writes an HTML report under `coverage/`.

## Linting and Formatting

### Linting

[Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) checks the code. It is a dev dependency, installed with `yarn install`.

```bash
yarn lint
```

`yarn lint --fix` applies the fixes Oxlint can make automatically.

### Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend enabling type-aware lint rules by installing `oxlint-tsgolint` and editing `.oxlintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "plugins": ["react", "typescript", "oxc"],
  "options": {
    "typeAware": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "react/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react/only-export-components": ["warn", { "allowConstantExport": true }]
  }
}
```

See the [Oxlint rules documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules) for the full list of rules and categories.

### Formatting

[Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) formats the code. It is a dev dependency, installed with `yarn install`.

```bash
yarn format
```

`yarn format --check` reports files that are not formatted and does not change them.

## Data Fetching

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/) sends HTTP. [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) decides when a request runs and keeps the cache, loading state, and errors.

`src/api/client.ts` creates one Axios instance with `withCredentials: true`, so the browser sends the session cookie. Functions in `src/api` call that instance. Reads use `useQuery` and pass its `AbortSignal` into Axios, so the request cancels when the query is dropped. Writes use `useMutation`. `App` holds one `QueryClient` inside `QueryClientProvider`. An Axios error whose body is a problem is mapped to a catalog message with `messageForProblem`.

The session query is the exception. A `401` means there is no session, so that query returns `null` and the status is signed out. Other failed requests surface as an error.
